In this challenge, we were placed in a restricted environment using `chroot`, which changes the apparent root directory of the filesystem to a jail directory like `/tmp/jail-XXXXXX`. However, the binary failed to call `chdir("/")` after the `chroot` call, meaning the process's current working directory remained outside the jail. This subtle oversight allowed us to use relative paths (like `../../flag`) to escape the jail and access files from the real root filesystem. The program also required that standard output be redirected to a file named `myflag`, and standard error to a file named `instructions`. By running `/challenge/babyjail_level1 ../../flag > myflag 2> instructions`, we fulfilled all the I/O redirection checks and tricked the binary into reading the real `/flag` file outside the jail. The flag was then written to `myflag`, successfully bypassing the sandbox constraints through a simple but classic filesystem escape.
