In this challenge, we were given a file recovered from a 32-bit system, but the data appeared to be scrambled or disorganized. The prompt mentioned that the bytes were arranged in a "weird way," and the file type itself was unknown. Upon opening the file in CyberChef, the content was unreadable binary data, with hints that the issue could be related to how the bytes were stored. Considering the file came from a 32-bit system, it was likely that the endianness—specifically the order of bytes in 4-byte (32-bit) words—was incorrect. To investigate further, the file was loaded into CyberChef, and a simple two-step recipe was applied. First, the “Swap endianness” operation was used, with the data format set to "Raw" and the word length set to 4 bytes, ensuring incomplete words were padded. Then, the “Render Image” operation was applied to visualize the binary data. After performing these steps, an image was successfully rendered in the output pane, revealing a hidden message. The flag, clearly visible in the image, was `picoCTF{notITEd._indI4n_s0rrY_3nDian_004850bf}`. This confirmed that the data had been stored in a little-endian format and needed to be converted to big-endian to be interpreted correctly.
