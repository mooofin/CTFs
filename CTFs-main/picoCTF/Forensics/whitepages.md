The challenge involved a file filled with invisible whitespace characters. I discovered that it contained exactly two different types of whitespace, so I suspected they could represent binary digits. I wrote a Python script to parse the file, mapping one whitespace character to `0` and the other to `1`, then converted the resulting binary string into readable text, successfully revealing the hidden message.
