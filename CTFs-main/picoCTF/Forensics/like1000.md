I was given a file named `999.tar`. Upon inspecting it, I discovered it contained another `.tar` file, and this nesting continued recursively. Manually extracting 1000 nested tar files wasnâ€™t practical, so I automated the process.

I wrote a Python script that loops from 999 down to 1, opening each tar file, extracting it, and moving to the next. This allowed me to quickly and efficiently reach the innermost file without manual intervention.

```python
import tarfile

for i in range(999, 0, -1):
    filename = str(i) + '.tar'
    tar = tarfile.open(filename)
    tar.extractall()
    tar.close()
```

After running the script, I found the final file: `flag.png`. This contained the flag and completed the challenge.
