I solved the "So Meta" challenge from picoCTF by analyzing the image's metadata. The challenge prompt provided a PNG file and asked me to "find the flag in this picture," suggesting that the information might not be visually embedded in the image itself but hidden within the file's metadata. I used `exiftool`, a command-line utility for reading and writing metadata in various file formats. Since my system didn’t have it installed, I installed it using my package manager. Once installed, I ran `exiftool pico_img.png` and examined the output.

The metadata revealed several standard fields such as image dimensions, software used, and timestamps. However, what stood out was the "Artist" field, which contained the flag: `picoCTF{s0_m3ta_fec06741}`. This confirmed that the flag was hidden in plain sight within the image’s metadata, rather than through steganography or image analysis. The challenge highlighted the importance of checking non-visual data when investigating files in forensic challenges.
