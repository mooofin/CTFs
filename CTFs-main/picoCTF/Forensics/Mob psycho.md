I started by downloading the `mobpsycho.apk` file using `wget` from the provided picoCTF link. To keep things organized, I created a new directory called `mobpsycho_apk` using `mkdir` and unzipped the contents of the APK into it with `unzip mobpsycho.apk -d mobpsycho_apk`. After navigating into the folder using `cd mobpsycho_apk`, I ran `strings * | grep flag` to scan all files for any references to the word "flag". Toward the end of the output, I spotted a reference to `res/color/flag.txt`, suggesting it could contain the flag. To verify, I ran `cat res/color/flag.txt`, which displayed a hex-encoded string. I then piped the contents through `xxd -r -p` using `cat res/color/flag.txt | xxd -r -p` to decode the hex into readable text.
