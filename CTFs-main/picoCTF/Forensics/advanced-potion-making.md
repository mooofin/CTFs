The challenge provided a corrupted file that appeared to be a PNG image based on partial header bytes (`89 50 42 11`). To repair it, I compared the file against a known-good PNG's structure using a hex editor. Noticing the signature mismatch (correct PNG headers should be `89 50 4E 47`), I manually fixed the first 8 bytes. Further comparison revealed proper chunk ordering (IHDR→IDAT→IEND), allowing me to reconstruct critical sections. While the repaired image opened normally, the flag remained hidden until applying grayscale conversion via an online tool, which revealed **`picoCTF{w1z4rdry}`** through contrast changes. This emphasized how forensic repairs often require both structural fixes and creative visualization techniques.
