I started by examining the code and immediately spotted the dangerous `strcpy(buf2, input)` line - that's always a red flag! The program was copying user input into a tiny 16-byte buffer with no size checks. I thought to myself: "This is just begging to be overflowed."

First, I tested with small inputs to understand normal behavior. Then I tried sending increasingly longer strings - 20 bytes, 30 bytes - watching how the program reacted. When I hit around 24 bytes, boom! Segmentation fault. But here's the clever part: instead of just crashing, the program's error handler gave me exactly what I wanted - the flag.

 The overflow was so bad it triggered the special `sigsegv_handler()` that the challenge creators helpfully included to print the flag.
