In this challenge, I encountered a vulnerable implementation of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game logic compared the user's move (`player_turn`) with the computer's move (`computer_turn`) to determine the outcome. However, instead of using exact string matching, the code relied on `strstr()` like this:

```c
if (strstr(player_turn, loses[computer_turn])) {
    // player loses
}
```

This is critical: `strstr()` checks whether the *losing string for the computer* exists **anywhere** in the player’s input. This means the logic doesn’t care whether the player actually typed a valid move like `"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"` — it only cares whether the input *contains* the word that beats the computer.

Knowing this, I realized I could game the system. Each round, the computer checks whether my input contains the string that would beat it. So, if the computer chooses `"rock"`, it looks for `"paper"` in my input to determine if I lose. If I input `"rockpaperscissors"`, it **always** contains the required string to trigger a win **against any of the three possible computer moves**:

* If the computer plays `"rock"`, my string contains `"paper"`, so I win.
* If it plays `"paper"`, my string contains `"scissors"`, I win again.
* If it plays `"scissors"`, it finds `"rock"` in my input, I win again.

To exploit this, I didn’t need a one-shot payload. Instead, I simply entered `"rockpaperscissors"` as my move **five times in a row**, each time at the prompt:

```
Please make your selection (rock/paper/scissors):
rockpaperscissors
```

And each time, I was rewarded with:

```
You played: rockpaperscissors
The computer played: <whatever>
You win!
```

By repeating this pattern across five rounds, I defeated the computer consistently. This flawed use of `strstr()` instead of `strcmp()` allowed my multi-string input to match *all losing conditions* for the computer at once. After the fifth win, the program granted me the flag:

###  Flag:

```
