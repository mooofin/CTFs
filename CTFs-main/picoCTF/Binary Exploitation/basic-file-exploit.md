While analyzing the code, I noticed a subtle conditional block that acts as a hidden backdoor to leak the flag. Specifically, the line `if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0)` caught my attention. Here, the program takes user input as a string and attempts to convert it into a `long` integer using `strtol`. This function parses the string in base 10 and assigns the resulting value to `entry_number`. If the result of the conversion is `0`, the condition evaluates to true, and the program proceeds to execute `puts(flag)`, printing the secret flag. This means that if I enter the value `0` when prompted for an entry number, the program will directly leak the flag. However, since `strtol` returns `0` not only for actual numeric input `"0"` but also for invalid strings like `"abcd"`, this condition could unintentionally trigger with malformed input as well.
