In the `picker-IV` binary challenge, I was given a simple executable to analyze. Since this was a binary exploitation problem, I started by opening a Nix shell with `gdb` using `nix-shell -p gdb`, which gave me a debugging environment suitable for reverse engineering. I then downloaded the challenge binary from the provided PicoCTF link using `wget`, and opened it in `gdb` to inspect the functions it contained.

Inside GDB, I ran `info function` to list all the functions present in the binary. Even though no debugging symbols were included, the output showed a list of functions with their addresses. Most notably, there was a function called `win` located at address `0x40129e`. This was a clear indicator of a potential vulnerability â€” many CTF challenges hide a secret `win()` function that gives the flag when called.

I then connected to the remote challenge using `nc saturn.picoctf.net 52529`, and the program prompted me to enter a memory address in hex. This was a strong hint that the program was insecurely jumping to a user-supplied address, possibly using a function pointer or direct jump instruction. Since I already knew the address of `win` from GDB (`0x40129e`), I entered it into the prompt.

The binary responded that I had won and immediately printed the flag:

```
picoCTF{n3v3r_jump_t0_u53r_5uppl13d_4ddr35535_01672a61}
```

This confirmed the vulnerability: the program blindly jumped to whatever address I supplied, which allowed me to redirect execution flow directly to the `win` function. This is a classic example of **insecure control flow transfer**, often seen in CTFs and real-world binary exploitation scenarios.

In summary, I used GDB on Nix to disassemble the binary, identified the `win` function address, and exploited a vulnerable jump instruction by supplying that address to the remote service. This type of challenge teaches the importance of never trusting user input when dealing with raw memory addresses or function pointers.
