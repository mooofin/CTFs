In this challenge, I explored heap overflow vulnerabilities — a lesser-known but powerful attack that happens when dynamically allocated memory (the heap) is overwritten by user input. The goal was to modify a variable (safe_var) stored on the heap to trigger a hidden flag in the program.

Unlike typical stack overflow attacks, this challenge targeted the heap: a memory area used for dynamically allocated data. By understanding the memory layout and calculating the distance between the two heap variables (input_data and safe_var), I was able to overflow input_data and overwrite safe_var with new data.

The program’s check_win() function checked if safe_var was still "bico". If it wasn’t, the program printed the flag! By carefully overflowing the input_data buffer with at least 33 bytes of input, I was able to overwrite safe_var — causing the check to succeed and reveal the flag.
