The objective in the "hash-only" challenge is to extract the contents of `flag.txt`. The provided `flaghasher` binary only outputs the file's MD5 hash, obscuring the flag.

A custom script named `md5sum` was created to solve this. The script first uses `cat "$@"` to print the target file's contents and then executes `/bin/md5sum "$@"` to mimic the original program's behavior. The `flaghasher` binary was then run with a modified `PATH` variable (`PATH=.:$PATH ./flaghasher`), forcing the system to execute the custom script in the local directory. This action exposed the flag's content.
