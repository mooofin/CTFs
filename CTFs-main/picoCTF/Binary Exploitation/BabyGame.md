In the *BabyGame* challenge from picoCTF, the objective is to navigate a map using the keys `w`, `a`, `s`, and `d` to reach the exit tile located at position `(29, 89)`. Connecting to the game via `nc saturn.picoctf.net 60352` launches a simple interface where the player can move around the map. At first, reaching the exit seems easy—simply move using `s` and `d` to reach the target coordinates. However, upon arrival, the game prints "You win!" but doesn't display the flag. After experimenting further, it became clear that simply reaching the exit isn't enough—the player must also be holding the flag. While exploring, I discovered that repeatedly pressing `a` (move left) at the top-left corner of the map caused the "Player has flag" value to change. Specifically, pressing `a` four times changed the value to `64`, indicating the player now holds the flag. Moving back into the main area using `d` reduced the value to `46`, which is still non-zero. With the flag value set, I navigated back to the exit tile, and this time the game printed the actual flag. The key to solving the challenge was exploiting a memory bug by moving out-of-bounds at the top-left edge, which secretly toggled the internal flag variable, ultimately allowing access to the real flag upon victory.
