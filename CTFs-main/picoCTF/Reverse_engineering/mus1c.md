## **Initial Observations**  
1. The text resembles **song lyrics**, but certain keywords (`shout`, `put`, `knock down`, `build up`) suggest it might be **code in an esoteric programming language**.  
2. Searching for `"shout" "put" programming language` leads to **Rockstar**, a language designed to look like rock ballads.  
3. The challenge name, **"mus1c"**, further hints at a music-related programming language.  

## **Step 1: Identifying the Language**  
- **Rockstar** is a satirical programming language where:  
  - `shout` = print  
  - `put` = variable assignment  
  - `knock down` = decrement  
  - `build up` = increment  
- **Verification:** Running the given lyrics in a [Rockstar interpreter](https://codewithrockstar.com/online) produces:  
  ```

  ```

## **Step 2: Decoding the Output**  
The numbers appear to be **ASCII codes**. Converting them:  

| Decimal | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| 114     | 'r'       |
| 114     | 'r'       |
| 114     | 'r'       |
| 111     | 'o'       |
| 99      | 'c'       |
| 107     | 'k'       |
| 110     | 'n'       |
| 114     | 'r'       |
| 110     | 'n'       |
| 48      | '0'       |
| 49      | '1'       |
| 49      | '1'       |
| 51      | '3'       |
| 114     | 'r'       |

Concatenating them gives:  
**`rrrocknrn0113r`**  

## **Step 3: Constructing the Flag**  
Following the challenge's instructions, we wrap the decoded string in `picoCTF{}`:  
**`picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}`**  

## **Final Answer**  
The flag is:  
```
picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}
```
