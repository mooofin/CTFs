Once the process was allowed to proceed, I turned to static analysis to inspect the file's internal structure. I ran binwalk -e bininst2.exe, which revealed an LZMA-compressed data block at offset 0x6000. However, the extraction process initially failed due to a symlink conflict caused by a previously existing output file. I resolved this by deleting the conflicting symlink and rerunning the extraction. After successful decompression, binwalk produced an output directory containing decompressed.bin, which I suspected held the actual payload or flag.

To investigate further, I ran the strings utility on decompressed.bin to identify any readable or suspicious content. Among the output, I found a base64-encoded string: cGljb0NURntmcjFkYV9mMHJfYjFuX2luNXRydW0zbnQ0dGlvbiFfYjIxYWVmMzl9. Decoding it revealed the final flag: picoCTF{fr1da_f0r_b1n_in5trum3nt4tion!_b21aef39}. This challenge showcased a combination of both dynamic and static reverse engineering techniques: from live process instrumentation using Frida to binary data extraction with binwalk and manual decoding via base64.
