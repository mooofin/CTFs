Overview
In this challenge, I was provided with a piece of code that transformed data from the file flag.txt and wrote the result to rev_this. The transformation involved simple mathematical operations on the data, and my task was to reverse this process to recover the original data.

The transformation process involved:

The first 8 bytes being written unchanged.

For bytes 8 through 22:

Even-indexed bytes (relative to the transformed segment) had 5 added.

Odd-indexed bytes had 2 subtracted.

An additional unknown byte, local_41, was added at the end.

My goal was to reverse this transformation to recover the original data from rev_this.

Reversing the Logic
Steps:
Understanding the Code:

The provided C code reads 24 bytes from flag.txt and applies transformations to certain bytes.

The first 8 bytes are unchanged.

For the next 16 bytes, the transformations are:

Even-indexed bytes had 5 added.

Odd-indexed bytes had 2 subtracted.

Finally, an unknown byte (local_41) is appended to the result.

Reversing the Transformation:

To reverse the transformation:

For the first 8 bytes, I simply copied them to the output file.

For the next 16 bytes, I subtracted 5 from even-indexed bytes (relative to this part of the data) and added 2 to odd-indexed bytes.

The last byte (local_41) was unknown, so I assumed it was 0x00 in the reversal process.

Python Script:
I created a Python script to automate the reversal process. The script does the following:

Opens the rev_this file in binary mode for reading.

Reads the first 24 bytes.

Writes the first 8 bytes unchanged to the output file.

Reverses the transformation for the next 16 bytes based on whether the index is even or odd.

Writes the unknown byte (local_41) as 0x00 to the output file.

Writes the result to a new file, reversed_flag.txt.
``` def reverse_logic():
    # Open the input file ("rev_this") and the output file ("reversed_flag.txt") in binary mode
    try:
        with open("rev_this", "rb") as f_in, open("reversed_flag.txt", "wb") as f_out:
            # Read the content from the input file (24 bytes)
            content = f_in.read(24)
            
            if len(content) < 1:
                print("No data found in 'rev_this'. Exiting.")
                return
            
            # Process the first 8 bytes (no transformation)
            for i in range(8):
                f_out.write(bytes([content[i]]))  # Write the byte directly
                
            # Process the next 16 bytes with the reverse transformation
            for i in range(8, 23):
                if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index (relative to this part)
                    f_out.write(bytes([content[i] - 5]))  # Undo the +5
                else:  # Odd index
                    f_out.write(bytes([content[i] + 2]))  # Undo the -2
            
            # Handle the last byte (local_41), which is not known in the original code
            # Here you would need to know what value it holds, for now, I'm using 0x00
            f_out.write(bytes([0x00]))  # Write an unknown byte (0x00 placeholder)

        print("Reversed data written to 'reversed_flag.txt'.")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: 'rev_this' file not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Run the reverse logic function
reverse_logic()
```
How to Run the Script:
Save the Python script: Save the provided Python script to a file, e.g., reverse_logic.py.

Execute the script:

Ensure that the rev_this file is present in the same directory as the script.

Run the script using Python 3:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 reverse_logic.py
Check the Output: The reversed data will be written to the file reversed_flag.txt.

Conclusion:
By reversing the transformations step by step, I was able to recover the original data and write it to reversed_flag.txt. The script successfully handled the transformations and written the reversed data as intended.
