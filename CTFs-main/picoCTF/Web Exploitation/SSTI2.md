Initial testing for Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) involved injecting basic expressions like `{{7*7}}`, which returned `49`, confirming that the input was being evaluated by a server-side template engine. Further testing with `{{7*'7'}}` produced `7777777`, indicating that the engine supports Python-style operations such as string multiplication. According to PortSwiggerâ€™s SSTI decision tree, this pattern strongly suggests the use of the Jinja2 template engine, as it uniquely interprets expressions in this manner. These results confirm both the presence of an SSTI vulnerability and the underlying use of Jinja2.

Finally after testing
