# picoCTF 2025 - "Inclusivity" Challenge Writeup

## Challenge Description
In this challenge, I found the flag split across two files: `script.js` and `style.css`.

---

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. I examined `script.js` and found the first part of the flag:
   ```
   picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_
   ```
2. Then, I checked `style.css` and found the second part:
   ```
   f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}
   ```
3. By removing `_1of2_` and `_2of2_` and combining both parts, I reconstructed the full flag:
   ```
   picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_f7w_b8f4b022}
   ```

## Final Flag
```
picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_f7w_b8f4b022}
```

## Lessons Learned
- Sometimes, CTF flags are split across multiple files.
- Identifying and removing unnecessary markers is crucial.
- Always check JavaScript and CSS files in web-based challenges.

This challenge was a simple **flag reconstruction task** that required careful examination of different files.
