### 1. Inspecting the Homepage

Start by accessing the challenge URL in your browser. Open the **Developer Tools** or right-click and select **View Page Source**.

>  Inside the HTML comment, you'll find the **first part** of the flag.

### 2. Check Linked `.css` File

Find and open the linked `.css` file. These files sometimes contain embedded comments or unused code.

>  The **second part** of the flag is found in a comment inside the CSS file.
### 3. Review JavaScript Files

Check the linked `.js` file. You’ll find a line referencing:

> “How can I keep Google from indexing my website?”

This is a hint pointing toward the usage of a `robots.txt` file.

### 4. Visit `robots.txt`

Open this URL in your browser:

```
http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/robots.txt
```

This file typically tells search engines what to avoid indexing. Here, it contains:

* The **third part** of the flag
* A clue: “I think this is an apache server… can you Access the next flag?”

### 5. Try Accessing `.htaccess`

Given the Apache server clue, try default config files. Open:

```
http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/.htaccess
```

This file is accessible and reveals:

* The **fourth part** of the flag
* Another hint: “I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.”

### 6. Look for `.DS_Store`

The `.DS_Store` file is created by macOS. It may reveal hidden files and directory structure.

Access:

```
http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/.DS_Store
```

This reveals the **fifth and final part** of the flag.
