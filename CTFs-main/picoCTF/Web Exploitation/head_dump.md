## Head-dump (Web Exploitation)



## Step 1: Exploring the Application

I started by launching the web application provided by the challenge. It's a simple blog-style website. I browsed through the available pages to see if anything stood out. One article titled **"API Documentation"** immediately caught my attention.

When I clicked on it, it redirected me to `/api-docs`, which loaded a **Swagger UI** interface. Swagger is commonly used to present REST API documentation in a user-friendly way, and it often includes functionality to test endpoints directly from the browser.

## Step 2: Investigating API Endpoints

Within Swagger, I started examining the listed API routes. Several were typical (like GET `/posts`, etc.), but one section labeled **"Diagnosing"** contained an interesting endpoint: `/heapdump`.

The description mentioned that this endpoint generates a snapshot of the server’s memory. Given the challenge’s name ("head-dump"), it seemed likely that this endpoint was the key.

## Step 3: Triggering the Heapdump

Using Swagger’s **"Try it out"** feature, I executed the `/heapdump` endpoint. This resulted in a download of a file named something like `heapdump-1742808189103.heapsnapshot`. This file contained a memory dump of the server’s heap.

## Step 4: Analyzing the Dump for the Flag

Heap snapshots can be very large, and manually searching through them would be inefficient. Instead, I used a simple command-line search to look for anything resembling the picoCTF flag format:

```bash
cat heapdump-1742808189103.heapsnapshot | grep picoCTF
```

That immediately returned the flag:
