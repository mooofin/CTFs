### picoCTF Challenge: Cookie Manipulation

In this challenge, we are presented with a portal that appears more secure than the previous ones — it doesn’t expose sensitive data directly on the client side. Upon logging in, nothing looks suspicious at first glance, but by inspecting the browser's **Developer Tools**, specifically the **Application tab**, we find an opportunity for exploitation.

The site sets **three cookies** in the browser:

* `username`: a string representing the logged-in user
* `password`: a string, possibly hashed or arbitrary
* `admin`: a boolean value, set to `False` by default

The goal is to gain **admin access**. Since the site relies on cookies for determining user privileges, we try flipping the value of the `admin` cookie:

```bash
admin=True
```

Once this change is made and the page is refreshed or a login is retried, the server interprets us as an **admin user**, and grants access to the protected content.

This reveals the flag:

```
picoCTF{th3_c0nsp1r4cy_l1v3s_d1c24fef}
```
