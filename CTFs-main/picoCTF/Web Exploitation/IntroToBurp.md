# Solving "IntroToBurp" – picoCTF Web Exploitation (Easy)



---
##  Step 1: Visit the Challenge URL

When you open the link provided in the challenge, you land on a registration page. Fill out the required fields (like username, password, etc.) and hit the **Register** button.

---

##  Step 2: The OTP Page

After registration, you’re taken to a page asking for a one-time password (OTP). At this point, I just entered a random value and clicked **Submit**. Not surprisingly, it returned an **“Invalid OTP”** message.

---

##  Step 3: Time to Use Burp Suite

Since the challenge is called *IntroToBurp*, it’s clear we’re expected to dig deeper using Burp Suite.

1. Click the browser’s **Back** button to return to the OTP input page.
2. Enter another random value but **intercept the request using Burp Suite**.
3. Send the captured request to the **Repeater** tab for further testing.

---

##  Step 4: Fuzzing the Request

In the Repeater tab, I tested a few things:

- SQL Injection payloads
- XSS payloads
- Replacing the OTP with random characters
- Submitting an empty value like `otp=`

All of these returned the same response: **“Invalid OTP.”**

---

##  Step 5: The Breakthrough

Then I tried something different.

Since this is a **POST** request, it usually expects a body (like `otp=0000`).  
I removed the body **entirely** — sending a POST request **without any `otp=` parameter** at all.

And that was it!

Instead of the usual error message, the server responded with the **flag**.
