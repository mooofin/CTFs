This challenge looked identical to the previous Irish-Name-Repo challenges, but this time, entering `' or 1=1--` caused an HTTP 500 error. Oddly, there was only a password field, and no obvious way to see the query. On inspecting the pageâ€™s HTML, I noticed a hidden input field set to `0`. Changing this to `1` revealed the query after the encryption.

When I submitted `' or 1=1--`, the output showed:

```
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = '' be 1=1--'
```

Notably, `or` was transformed into `be`. Testing further with the entire alphabet revealed a Caesar cipher rotation of 13 (ROT13). Adjusting my payload to the ciphered version, `' be 1=1--`, bypassed the filter and let me log in as admin, ultimately revealing the flag.
