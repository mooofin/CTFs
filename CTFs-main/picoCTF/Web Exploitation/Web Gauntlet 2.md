In the Web Gauntlet 2 challenge, we were presented with a login page that echoed back the SQL query being executed on the server. The objective was to log in as the `admin` user. However, a long list of SQL keywords and characters were filtered out, including `or`, `and`, `union`, `like`, `=`, `admin`, and even `true` and `false`. Additionally, the server was running on SQLite, which hinted at the possibility of using SQLite-specific operators. First, I tested how the input was parsed by injecting single quotes in the `username` and `password` fields. The application responded by showing the full SQL query with my inputs inserted, which confirmed the ability to inject SQL.

To bypass the `admin` keyword filter, I used SQLite’s string concatenation operator `||` and sent the username as `adm'||'in`, which would concatenate to `admin` at runtime without being blocked. For the password, I needed to bypass the equality check without using `=`, `like`, or `or`. I found that SQLite supports the `GLOB` operator, which acts like `LIKE` but uses Unix shell–style wildcards. Since `*` matches any string, I set the password field to `' glob '*'`, which effectively matched any password. The final injected query looked like this:

```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='adm'||'in' AND password='' glob '*'
```

This bypassed both filters and password checks, logging me in as admin. After successful login, the page revealed some PHP code and the flag. The flag for the challenge was: `picoCTF{0n3_m0r3_t1m3_86f3e77f3c5a076866a0fdb3b29c52fd}`.
