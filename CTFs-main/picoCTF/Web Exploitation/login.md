# SQL Injection Attempt Leads to Base64 Discovery - Writeup

## Initial Approach
 I began by testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities on a web form. After several payloads failed to work, I examined the source code and discovered an interesting JavaScript file (`index.js`) that contained some intriguing functions.

## Key Findings

The most interesting parts of the code were:
1. The form method implementation
2. A particular return line that used the `btoa` function

After researching, I learned that:
- `btoa` encodes strings to base64
- `atob` decodes base64 back to ASCII

## The Discovery Process

While analyzing the source code, I noticed an encoded string:
`"cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ"`

Using one of these methods:
1. A online decoder like https://www.base64decode.org/
2. Or directly in a Node.js shell with:
   ```javascript
   console.log(atob("cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ"));
   ```

## The Flag

The decoded string revealed the flag:
```
picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}
```
