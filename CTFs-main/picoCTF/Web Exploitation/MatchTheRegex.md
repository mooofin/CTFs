## Writeup: Extracting the Flag via Regex Matching

### Step 1: Open the URL
First, I navigated to the challenge-provided URL and explored its functionality.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Source Code
Upon inspecting the source code, I found a JavaScript function named `send_request()` that sends a request to `/flag` with user input as a query parameter.

```javascript
function send_request() {
    let val = document.getElementById("name").value;
    // ^p.....F!?
    fetch(`/flag?input=${val}`)
        .then(res => res.text())
        .then(res => {
            const res_json = JSON.parse(res);
            alert(res_json.flag)
            return false;
        })
    return false;
}
```

### Step 3: Identifying the Regular Expression Constraint
I noticed a commented regex pattern: `^p.....F!?`, which suggests that the flag:
- Starts with `p`
- Has five arbitrary characters following `p`
- Ends with `F!?`

### Step 4: Exploiting the Pattern
I used an input that followed the identified pattern to force the server to return the flag.
By iterating possible values and testing for valid responses, I successfully retrieved the flag.

### Conclusion
Understanding the client-side script and its validation mechanism was crucial in identifying how the flag was processed and extracted.
