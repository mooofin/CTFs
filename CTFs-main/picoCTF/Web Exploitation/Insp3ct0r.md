####  Viewing the Page Source

The first step in any web-based CTF challenge is to **view the source code** of the page. In most browsers, you can do this by:

* Right-clicking anywhere on the page â†’ `View Page Source`, or
* Pressing `Ctrl + U`

When we open the page source, we find an **HTML comment**:

```html
<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->
```

This gives us the **first part** of the flag:

```
picoCTF{tru3_d3
```

---

####  Inspecting CSS

Since the flag is split into 3 parts, we next check the CSS. This could be in:

* An inline `<style>` tag,
* A linked CSS file (e.g., `style.css`)

After checking the CSS, we find this comment:

```css
/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */
```

This gives us the **second part**:

```
t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t
```

---

####  Checking the JavaScript

Next, we inspect any **JavaScript files** linked to the page or within `<script>` tags. In one of the JS files, we find the final piece:

```javascript
// Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?f10be399
```

This gives us the **third and final part**:

```
_lucky?f10be399
```

---

###  Assembling the Flag

Putting all three parts together:

```
picoCTF{tru3_d3 + t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t + _lucky?f10be399}
```
