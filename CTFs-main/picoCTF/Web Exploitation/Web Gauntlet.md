In this SQL injection challenge, we face a multi-round login bypass task with progressively stricter filters. In **Round 1**, only the `or` keyword is blocked. By examining the executed SQL query shown in the error, we see it checks both username and password. We bypass this by commenting out the password clause using `--`, and log in with the payload `admin' --`. In **Round 2**, `--` is filtered, along with other operators like `and`, `or`, `like`, and `=`. Here, we exploit SQLite's ability to use block comments (`/* */`) instead, so we input `admin' /*` to bypass the password check. **Round 3** blocks even more, including comparison operators and the comment syntax, but we can still terminate the SQL query early using a semicolon `;`, making the payload `admin';` effective. **Round 4** increases the difficulty by blocking the keyword `admin`. We evade this by using SQLiteâ€™s string concatenation with `||`, submitting `ad'||'min';` to reconstruct `admin`. An alternate method here involves a filtered `UNION` query with obfuscated spaces using `/**/`, like `sobatista'/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/*/**/FROM/**/users/**/LIMIT/**/1;`, which returns the admin record. In **Round 5**, most previous techniques including `union`, `admin`, and common SQL operators are blocked, but the concatenation trick still works, allowing access with `ad'||'min';`.
