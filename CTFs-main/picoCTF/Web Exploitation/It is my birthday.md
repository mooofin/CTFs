The PicoCTF challenge titled "It is my birthday" falls under the Web Exploitation category and is worth 100 points. The prompt hints at a scenario where the user is required to upload two PDF files that are “slightly different” yet have the same MD5 hash—this is a strong indication of an MD5 hash collision being the key to solving the challenge. Upon visiting the provided URL (http://mercury.picoctf.net:55343/), there is a file upload interface. Uploading regular PDFs results in an error stating that the MD5 hashes do not match. This confirms that the server is likely comparing the hash values of both uploaded files, and only accepting them if the hashes are identical. Since MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, one can use specially crafted PDFs with different contents but identical MD5 hashes to bypass this check. Such colliding PDFs are available publicly—for example, from this page, where hello.pdf and erase.pdf are a well-known MD5 collision pair. Downloading and uploading these files to the challenge webpage satisfies the server’s condition, revealing the flag: picoCTF{cOngr4ts_u_r_1nv1t3d_aad886b9}.
