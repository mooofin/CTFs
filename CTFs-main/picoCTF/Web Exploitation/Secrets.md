# PicoCTF Web Challenge: Finding Hidden Pages

## Challenge Description

**Task:** "We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag?"  
**Target Website:** [http://saturn.picoctf.net:55131/](http://saturn.picoctf.net:55131/)

The objective is to discover hidden directories and files on this web server to locate the flag.

## Understanding Web Directories

Think of a web server like a file cabinet with folders (directories) and files inside it. These folders and files are accessed using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). For example, when you visit:

```
http://saturn.picoctf.net:55131/secret/
```

- If **directory listing is enabled** and no `index.html` exists, the server will show all files inside the `secret/` folder.
- If **directory listing is disabled**, the server might return a "403 Forbidden" error.
- If an `index.html` file exists, the server will display that file instead of listing directory contents.

This understanding helps us find hidden files manually by guessing directory names or using web tools like `dirb`, `gobuster`, or `wfuzz`.

## Step 1: Inspecting the Website

We start by right-clicking on the page and selecting **Inspect** to open the browser's developer tools. Under the **Sources** tab, we can see files that are part of the websiteâ€™s frontend.

### Observations:
- Files are located inside an `/assets/` directory.
- This directory is under a **hidden** `/secret/` directory.
- The `/secret/` directory is not linked from the main page, but it exists on the server.

## Step 2: Exploring Hidden Directories

### Checking `/secret/`
Visiting:
```
http://saturn.picoctf.net:55131/secret/
```
We find a message: **"You almost found me!"**

This suggests there are more hidden files or directories.

### Checking `/secret/hidden/`
Adding `hidden/` to the path:
```
http://saturn.picoctf.net:55131/secret/hidden/
```
Another page appears, suggesting another level of directories.

### Checking `/secret/hidden/superhidden/`
```
http://saturn.picoctf.net:55131/secret/hidden/superhidden/
```
Finally, we see the flag displayed!

## Explanation of URLs and Directory Traversal

### Trailing Slash (`/`)
- **`http://saturn.picoctf.net:55131/secret/`** â†’ The server knows `secret` is a **directory** and serves its default file (`index.html`, etc.).
- **`http://saturn.picoctf.net:55131/secret`** â†’ The server might not recognize it as a directory, resulting in an error.

### How Websites Hide Directories
- Some directories are not linked on the main page.
- `robots.txt` may block them from search engines but doesn't prevent manual access.
- They might contain a blank `index.html` file to prevent listing.

## Tools for Automated Discovery
If manual guessing is slow, we can use tools to find hidden directories:

### `dirb` (Linux)
```sh
 dirb http://saturn.picoctf.net:55131/
```

### `gobuster` (Linux)
```sh
 gobuster dir -u http://saturn.picoctf.net:55131/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

### `wfuzz` (Linux)
```sh
 wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt --hc 404 http://saturn.picoctf.net:55131/FUZZ/
```

These tools attempt to brute-force directory names using common wordlists.

## Conclusion
By using a combination of manual inspection and automated tools, we successfully found the hidden flag at:

```
http://saturn.picoctf.net:55131/secret/hidden/superhidden/
```

Flag: `picoCTF{Hidden_Files_Are_Not_So_Hidden}` ðŸŽ‰

This challenge demonstrated the importance of inspecting a websiteâ€™s structure and knowing how web directories work. Happy hacking! ðŸš€
