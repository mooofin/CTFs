During the assessment, I discovered a File Upload Vulnerability on the target instance, allowing arbitrary file uploads. I exploited this by uploading a PHP shell script (shell.php) that executes system commands via the cmd parameter. After successful upload, I accessed the shell at http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54697/uploads/shell.php?cmd=, confirming RCE by running whoami, which revealed the service was running as www-data. Privilege escalation checks via sudo -l showed www-data had unrestricted sudo access ((ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL), enabling root commands without a password. Finally, I retrieved the flag by executing sudo cat /root/flag.txt through the webshell, completing the compromise chain from file upload to root access
