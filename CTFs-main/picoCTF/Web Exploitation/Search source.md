# **picoCTF Web Challenge Writeup: Extracting the Hidden Flag Using `grep`**

## **Introduction**

This writeup documents the process of solving a picoCTF challenge that required extracting a hidden flag from a website. The steps involve downloading the website files, searching for the flag using command-line tools, and understanding how the `grep` command works in Linux.

## **Step 1: Downloading the Website Files**

In Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, if a website is involved, the first step is to retrieve its contents for offline analysis. The most efficient way to do this is by using tools like `wget` or `httrack`.

### **Using `wget` to Clone the Website**

```bash
wget -r -np -k http://saturn.picoctf.net:60772/
```

#### **Explanation:**
- `wget` → A command-line tool to download files from the internet.
- `-r` → Recursively download all linked pages.
- `-np` → No parent, which prevents wget from moving to parent directories.
- `-k` → Convert links to work for offline viewing.
- `http://saturn.picoctf.net:60772/` → The URL of the challenge website.

This command downloads all accessible files from the website and saves them locally for further investigation.

## **Step 2: Searching for the Flag Using `grep`**

Once the website is downloaded, the next step is to search for the flag. CTF flags typically follow a format like `picoCTF{...}`, so searching for "picoCTF" is a logical first step.

```bash
grep -nr "picoCTF" .
```

### **Understanding `grep` and Its Options**
`grep` (Global Regular Expression Print) is a command-line tool used to search for specific text patterns within files. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the command used:

- `grep` → The command to search for patterns in files.
- `-n` → Displays the line number where the match is found.
- `-r` → Searches recursively in all files and subdirectories.
- `"picoCTF"` → The string we are searching for.
- `.` → Represents the current directory and all its contents.

This command scans all files in the current directory, searching for occurrences of `picoCTF` and displaying results with line numbers.

## **Step 3: Extracting the Flag**

After running the `grep` command, the output displayed:

```
./saturn.picoctf.net_60761/css/style.css:328: /** banner_main picoCTF{1nsp3tion_of_w3bpag3s_ec95fa49} **/
```

### **Breaking Down the Output**
- `./saturn.picoctf.net_60761/css/style.css` → This is the file where the match was found.
- `328` → The line number in the file where the match occurs.
- `/** banner_main picoCTF{1nsp3tion_of_w3bpag3s_ec95fa49} **/` → This is the actual content, and within it is the flag.

Thus, the extracted flag is:

```
picoCTF{1nsp3tion_of_w3bpag3s_ec95fa49}
```

## **Conclusion**

This challenge demonstrated how to efficiently extract hidden information from a website using `wget` to download files and `grep` to search for specific keywords. By understanding how to navigate directories and utilize Linux command-line tools, we can effectively locate and retrieve hidden flags in CTF challenges.
