# **Inspector HTML CTF Challenge Writeup**

## **Challenge Overview**
The challenge provided a website and prompted us to find a hidden flag.

---

## **Step 1: Inspecting the Webpage Source Code**
Since the challenge name suggested something related to **inspection**, we right-clicked on the webpage and selected **Inspect (or View Page Source)**.

---

## **Step 2: Checking the HTML Source**
In the **Sources** or **Elements** tab, we searched for any hidden comments or embedded content.

After scrolling through the HTML, we found the flag hidden inside an HTML comment:

```html
<!-- Flag: picoCTF{1n5p3t0r_0f_h7ml_dd513514} -->
```

---

## **Step 3: Retrieving the Flag**
We extracted the flag directly from the comment:

```
picoCTF{1n5p3t0r_0f_h7ml_dd513514}
```

## **Final Notes and Key Takeaways**
1. **Always Inspect the Source Code:** Many web challenges hide information in HTML comments or JavaScript files.
2. **Use Developer Tools:** The browser **Inspect Element** tool is crucial for finding hidden flags.
3. **Look for Embedded Data:** Sometimes flags are inside hidden fields, inline scripts, or external sources.

This method can be useful in **web security challenges, bug bounty hunting, and CTFs**.
