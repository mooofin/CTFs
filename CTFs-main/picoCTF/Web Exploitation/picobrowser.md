# PicoCTF Challenge: PicoBrowser

## Challenge Description
We are given a URL that can only be accessed using "picobrowser" as the User-Agent. The goal is to retrieve the flag from the given website.

## Solution

1. **Inspecting the Challenge**
   - The URL given is:
     ```
     https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/26704/
     ```
   - When trying to access the URL in a normal browser, we might be blocked. The site expects a specific User-Agent.

2. **Using Curl to Bypass Browser Check**
   - To bypass the restriction, we can use `curl` with a modified `User-Agent` header:
     ```bash
     curl 'https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/26704/flag' \
       -H 'User-Agent: picobrowser'
     ```
   - This command sends a request pretending to be "picobrowser" and successfully retrieves the webpage.

3. **Extracting the Flag**
   - The returned HTML contains the flag inside a `<p>` tag:
     ```html
     <p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px;"><b>Flag</b>: <code>picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_e9b160d0}</code></p>
     ```
   - The flag is:
     ```
     picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_e9b160d0}
     ```

## Conclusion
- The challenge tests our ability to manipulate HTTP headers to bypass client-side restrictions.
- Using `curl` with a custom `User-Agent` allowed us to access the hidden content.
- This method is useful in real-world scenarios where websites restrict access based on user agents.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_e9b160d0}`
