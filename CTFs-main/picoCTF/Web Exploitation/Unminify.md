# Unminify picoCTF{} Writeup

## **Challenge Overview**
**Category:** Web Exploitation  
**Level:** Easy  
**Challenge URL:** picoCTF â€” picoGym Challenges  

This challenge is an easy web exploitation challenge where the goal is to find a hidden flag in the websiteâ€™s source code.

---

## **Step 1: Accessing the Website**
We start by launching the challenge instance and accessing the provided URL:

```
http://titan.picoctf.net:53517/
```

Upon opening the webpage, we see a simple site with no obvious interactive elements.

---

## **Step 2: Viewing the Page Source**
Since this is a web challenge, we suspect that the flag might be hidden within the pageâ€™s HTML source code.

To check the source code, we press:

- **Windows/Linux:** `CTRL + U`
- **Mac:** `Command + Option + U`

This opens the raw HTML of the webpage.

---

## **Step 3: Searching for the Flag**
To quickly locate the flag, we use the browserâ€™s search function:

- **Windows/Linux:** `CTRL + F`
- **Mac:** `Command + F`

We search for `picoCTF{` and find the following snippet:

```html
<p class="picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_622b2c88}"></p>
```

This confirms that the flag is embedded within the HTML.

---

## **Step 4: Extracting the Flag Using Curl**
Instead of using a browser, we can also retrieve the HTML source code using `curl` in the terminal:

```
curl -s http://titan.picoctf.net:53517/
```

This outputs the entire HTML of the page. Searching within the output reveals the flag:

```
picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_622b2c88}
```

---

## **Final Notes and Key Takeaways**
1. **Always check the page source:** Many web challenges hide flags in the raw HTML.
2. **Use `CTRL + F` for quick searches:** This speeds up flag discovery in large HTML files.
3. **Automate with `curl` if needed:** Fetching the page with `curl` allows easy searching and automation.

This approach is useful in **web security challenges, bug bounty hunting, and CTFs**.

## **Future Approach for Similar Challenges**
1. **View page source using `CTRL + U`**
2. **Use `CTRL + F` to search for `picoCTF{`**
3. **Use `curl` in the terminal to fetch the page source**

For every CTF challenge, we will document steps in a similar way to ensure clarity and repeatability. ðŸš€
