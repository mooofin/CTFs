During the challenge, I encountered a gzip-compressed disk image (disko-1.dd.gz). To analyze it, I first decompressed the file using gzip -d disko-1.dd.gz, which produced the raw disk image disko-1.dd. Since manually mounting the image wasn't immediately necessary, I opted for a faster approach: scanning for the flag directly by extracting readable strings using the strings command. By piping the output into grep "pico", I quickly located the flag in the format picoCTF{...}. This method proved efficient for CTF scenarios where flags are often embedded as plaintext, allowing me to bypass full disk analysis and retrieve the flag with just two commands: gzip -d for extraction and strings | grep for targeted searching.
