Challenge 2: Cookies

Challenge Overview

Category: Web ExploitationLevel: EasyChallenge URL: picoCTF â€” picoGym Challenges

This challenge involves modifying cookie values to retrieve a hidden flag.

Step 1: Observing the Website Behavior

Open the challenge-provided URL.

Enter arbitrary input into the form.

If the input is invalid, an error message appears.

If you enter snickerdoodle, the page responds with I love snickerdoodle cookies!.

Step 2: Inspecting Cookies

Open the Developer Tools in your browser (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).

Navigate to the Application tab and look under Cookies.

Observe that a cookie value is set to 0.

Modify the cookie value to 1, 2, 3, etc., and refresh the page.

Each change results in a different output.

The goal is to find a cookie value that returns the flag.

Step 3: Automating with Python

To automate the process of testing different cookie values, use the following script:

This script:

Iterates through cookie values from 1 to 20.

Sends a request with the modified cookie.

Checks if the response does not contain I love (indicating a different message).

Prints the response if a possible flag is found.

Step 4: Retrieving the Flag

Once the correct cookie value is found, reload the page.

The flag is displayed.

Flag: picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_88acab36}

Final Notes and Key Takeaways

Web applications often use cookies for authentication or tracking.

Tampering with cookie values can reveal sensitive information.

Automating with Python can expedite enumeration tasks.

Future Approach for Similar Challenges

Use Burp Suite or Developer Tools to inspect cookies.

Modify and test different cookie values.

Automate enumeration using scripts for efficiency.

For every CTF challenge, we will document steps in a similar way to ensure clarity and repeatability. ðŸš€
