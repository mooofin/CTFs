### Forbidden Paths – Web Exploitation Writeup

**Challenge Summary:**
The website displayed a list of three text files and asked the user to input the name of the file they wanted to read. According to the challenge description, the actual flag was stored in `/flag.txt`, but the server was filtering out *absolute* paths, preventing direct access to `/flag.txt`.

---

### Exploitation Strategy

Since absolute paths like `/flag.txt` were blocked, we needed to find a way to **traverse the directory structure** to reach the root directory and access the flag file indirectly.

By using **directory traversal** techniques (`..` to move up a directory), we attempted to construct a relative path that would bypass the filter.

We used the following relative path:

```
../../../../flag.txt
```

This path works by moving up several directory levels (typically enough to reach the root, depending on the server’s directory depth), and then accesses the `flag.txt` file from there.

---

### Outcome

Entering `../../../../flag.txt` successfully bypassed the filter and allowed us to read the contents of the protected file. The flag was revealed, completing the challenge.

---

**Takeaway:**
When dealing with path restrictions, always consider whether the filter is targeting absolute paths (`/flag.txt`) or if relative traversal (`../../`) can bypass the checks. This is a common vulnerability known as **Path Traversal (Directory Traversal)**.
