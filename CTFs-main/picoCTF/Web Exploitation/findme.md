# PicoCTF Challenge: "Any Redirections?"

## **Challenge Overview**
The hint provided for this challenge was **"any redirections?"**, suggesting that something interesting might be happening with URL redirections when navigating through the website. The goal was to identify and extract the flag by inspecting these redirections.

---
## **Step 1: Logging into the Website**
Upon logging into the website, a search box was presented. Initially, I tried searching for different strings, but the search functionality did not return any visible results. This led me to suspect that the key to solving this challenge was hidden in the background requests.

---
## **Step 2: Intercepting Requests with Burp Suite**
Since the hint suggested investigating redirections, I used **Burp Suite** to capture the network traffic between my browser and the server. Here’s how I did it:

1. Opened **Burp Suite** and set up **intercept mode**.
2. Logged in again and captured the request.
3. Pressed **Forward** to allow the request to proceed while monitoring subsequent responses.

---
## **Step 3: Identifying Base64-Encoded Data in URLs**
While examining the captured requests, I noticed some GET requests containing **Base64-encoded strings**. These URLs followed this pattern:

```
GET /next-page/id=cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs
```

On another attempt, another similar request was intercepted:

```
GET /next-page/id=bF90aGVfd2F5X2RmNDRjOTRjfQ==
```

---
## **Step 4: Decoding the Base64 Data**

Since Base64 encoding is commonly used to obfuscate data, I decided to decode the two intercepted strings using **CyberChef**.

Decoded strings:

```
cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs  →  picoCTF{proxies_all
bF90aGVfd2F5X2RmNDRjOTRjfQ==  →  _the_way_df44c94c}
```

By combining both parts, the full flag was revealed:

```
picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_df44c94c}
```

---
## **Conclusion**
By leveraging **Burp Suite** to inspect network traffic, I was able to extract a hidden Base64-encoded flag embedded in the redirections. Decoding the Base64 values led to successfully retrieving the flag and completing the challenge!


**Final Flag:**
```
picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_df44c94c}
```
