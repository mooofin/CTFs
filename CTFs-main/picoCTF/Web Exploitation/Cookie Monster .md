## Solution Walkthrough

### Step 1: Understanding the Challenge
We are given a Base64-encoded string:
```
cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzXzc3MUQ1RUIwfQ==
```
Our goal is to decode this string to obtain the flag.

### Step 2: Decoding the Base64 String
We can decode the Base64 string using various methods, such as Python, CyberChef, or an online Base64 decoder. Using Python:
```python
import base64

encrypted_flag = "cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzXzc3MUQ1RUIwfQ=="
decoded_flag = base64.b64decode(encrypted_flag).decode('utf-8')
print(decoded_flag)
```
Running this script gives us the decoded flag:
```
picoCTF{c00k1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_771D5EB0}
```

### Step 3: Submitting the Flag
The final flag is:
```
picoCTF{c00k1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_771D5EB0}
```
Submit this to the challenge portal to complete the challenge.
