In this challenge, we were provided with a ZIP archive named `Addadshashanammu.zip`. Upon extraction, the archive revealed an unusually deep and complex nested directory structure. To efficiently navigate through these directories, tab completion in the terminal proved extremely useful. By progressively auto-completing directory names, we eventually located a file named `fang-of-haynekhtnamet` located at the deepest level of the hierarchy. After changing its permissions using `chmod +x`, we executed the file, which immediately output the flag: `picoCTF{l3v3l_up!_t4k3_4_r35t!_6f332f10}`
