In this challenge, I was given a ZIP archive called `Addadshashanammu.zip`. After unzipping it, I found an extremely deep and complex directory structure. Instead of manually typing out each folder, I used tab completion in the terminal to quickly navigate through the layers. Eventually, I came across a file named `fang-of-haynekhtnamet` at the very end of the path. I made it executable with `chmod +x`, ran it, and right away it printed the flag: `picoCTF{l3v3l_up!_t4k3_4_r35t!_6f332f10}`.
