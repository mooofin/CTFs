A **symbolic link**, or **symlink**, is a special type of file in Unix/Linux that acts as a **shortcut or pointer to another file or directory**. Unlike a hard link, which points directly to the file's data on disk, a symlink simply stores the path to the target file. When a program accesses a symlink, the system follows the path and accesses the real file it points to. Symlinks are created using the `ln -s` command (e.g., `ln -s /root/flag.txt banner`), and are useful for convenience, organizing files, and in some cases—exploits. For example, if a privileged script reads a file that you control, you can replace that file with a symlink to a protected file like `/etc/shadow` or `/root/flag.txt`, and the script will unintentionally access sensitive data.

In the “Abuse the Banner” challenge, the first step is to connect to the information-leaking server at `tethys.picoctf.net 57125` using netcat. This reveals a banner containing a password: `My_Passw@rd_@1234`. Using this password, we connect to the actual challenge server at `tethys.picoctf.net 50695`. After answering two trivia questions correctly—“defcon” for the top cyber security conference and “john draper” for the first phreaker—we gain shell access as the `player` user inside `/home/player`. Exploring the environment, we find that a Python script, running as root, displays a banner by reading the contents of `/home/player/banner`. Since the script is executed with root privileges but reads from a user-controlled location, we can exploit this by deleting the existing `banner` file and creating a symbolic link (`symlink`) pointing to `/root/flag.txt`, a file we normally can’t access. This is done using `rm banner` followed by `ln -s /root/flag.txt banner`. When we reconnect to the server, the script reads our symlink as root and prints the contents of the flag file as the banner. This classic symlink abuse technique leverages the discrepancy between file access permissions and execution privileges, successfully exposing the flag: `picoCTF{b4nn3r_gr4bb1n9_su((3sfu11y_8126...}`.
