After extracting the files, I use ls to confirm that the drop-in directory contains a Python file named message.py. To investigate the fileâ€™s revision history, I recall that Git can display a detailed log of changes made to any file. Running git log message.py provides commit hashes, authors, timestamps, and commit messages, offering a complete picture of the file's evolution.
