The challenge revolves around a file called enc_flag that appears to be base64-encoded. After downloading and inspecting the file with cat, I notice that the output strongly resembles base64-encoded data. Running base64 -d on the file reveals a slightly shorter, but still base64-like string, indicating multiple layers of encoding. Rather than guessing how many times to decode, I initially attempt a manual approach, chaining six base64 -d commands together. This reveals the flag after six rounds of decoding
