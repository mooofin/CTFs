The hexadecimal value `0x3D` can be converted to its decimal equivalent by understanding the base-16 number system. In hexadecimal, each digit represents a power of 16, starting from the rightmost digit. The value `0x3D` consists of two digits: `3` and `D`. Here, `3` is in the 16¹ place, and `D` represents 13 in decimal, placed in the 16⁰ position. To convert, we multiply each digit by its corresponding power of 16: `3 × 16 = 48` and `13 × 1 = 13`. Adding these gives `48 + 13 = 61`. Therefore, the decimal (base-10) equivalent of `0x3D` is **61**.
