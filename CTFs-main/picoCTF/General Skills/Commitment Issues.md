After extracting the archive, the `drop-in/` directory appears to contain only `message.txt`. Running `ls -la` reveals a hidden `.git` directory:

```bash
$ ls -la
...
drwxr-xr-x 8 user user  166 ... .git
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user   11 ... message.txt
```

This indicates the folder is a Git repository. Initialize it to interact with the Git data:

```bash
$ git init
$ git log
```

The log shows two commits. The latest one is labeled "remove sensitive info". The previous one is "create flag".

Checkout the older commit:

```bash
$ git checkout 7d3aa557f7ba7d116badaf5307761efb3622249
```

Then read the contents of `message.txt`:

```bash
$ cat message.txt
picoCTF{be3dd3da}
```
