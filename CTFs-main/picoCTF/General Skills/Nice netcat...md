Upon connecting to the challenge server at `mercury.picoctf.net` on port `7449` using `netcat`, a sequence of numeric values was returned line-by-line. Each number corresponded to an ASCII decimal representation of a character. By converting the numbers to their ASCII equivalents, the hidden flag could be reconstructed. For example, the decimal `112` maps to the character `'p'`, `105` to `'i'`, `99` to `'c'`, and so on. Applying this conversion across the entire sequence revealed the complete flag: `picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_f2d7cafa}`.
