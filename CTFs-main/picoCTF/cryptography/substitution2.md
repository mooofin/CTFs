Quipqiup starts by converting each ciphertext word into a letter pattern (e.g., “SILLY” becomes “ABCCD”). This helps it quickly find matching words from a dictionary sorted by these patterns. Once possible matches are found, it uses a recursive depth-first search to try different letter substitutions while keeping track of valid mappings. If a conflict occurs, it backtracks and tries a different path. To work efficiently, it prioritizes longer or more unique words first. It can also guess individual letters when full words can’t be matched.
