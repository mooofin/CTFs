For this challenge, I was given two files: `usernames.txt` and `passwords.txt`, which contained leaked login credentials from a blackmarket website. After locating the username `cultiris` on line 378 of `usernames.txt`, I checked the corresponding line in `passwords.txt` and found the encrypted string `cvpbPGS{P7e1S_54I35_71Z3}`. The format suggested it was a simple substitution cipher, so I used an online ROT13 decoder to decrypt it. Applying the cipher revealed the final flag: `picoCTF{C7r1F_54V35_71M3}`.
