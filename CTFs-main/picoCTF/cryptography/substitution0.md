 I was given a scrambled message that had a substitution cipher applied to it. Fortunately, the key was provided at the beginning of the message: `DECKFMYIQJRWTZPXGNABUSOLVH`. This represented the cipher alphabet, which maps directly to the standard English alphabet `A-Z`. To decode the message, I implemented a Python script that constructs a decryption map by pairing each letter in the cipher alphabet with the corresponding letter in the plain alphabet. I then iterated through each character of the encrypted text. If it was an uppercase or lowercase letter, I replaced it using the decryption map while preserving the case; if it was a punctuation mark or space, I left it unchanged. This allowed me to efficiently recover the original plaintext. At the end of the decoded message, I successfully retrieved the flag: `picoCTF{5UE5717U710Z_3S0WU710Z_59533D2F}`.
