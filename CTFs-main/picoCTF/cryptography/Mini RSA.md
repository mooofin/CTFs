In this challenge, I was given RSA parameters where the public exponent $e$ is small—specifically, $e = 3$—along with a large modulus $N$ and a ciphertext $C$. The hint mentioned that the plaintext was padded just enough so that $M^3$ is only slightly larger than $N$. I realized that since the padding was minimal, the cube of the plaintext $M$ must be close to $N$, meaning the ciphertext was likely computed as $C = M^3 \mod N$, where $M^3 = i \cdot N + C$ for some small integer $i$. So I rewrote the equation as $M^3 = i \cdot N + C$, and knew that if I could find the correct $i$, I could recover the original message by taking the integer cube root. I wrote a Python script using the `gmpy2` library to loop through small values of $i$, compute $i \cdot N + C$, and try to extract the cube root. When `iroot` returned a perfect cube, I converted the result to a hexadecimal string and then decoded it to get the original plaintext.
