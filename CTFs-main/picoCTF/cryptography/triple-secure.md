Three moduli—`n1`, `n2`, and `n3`—are generated by multiplying combinations of three large primes: `p`, `q`, and `r`. Specifically, `n1 = p × q`, `n2 = p × r`, and `n3 = q × r`. Because the same primes are reused across different moduli, the structure introduces a vulnerability.

RSA's security depends on the difficulty of factoring a large number into its prime components. However, when two RSA moduli share a prime, the greatest common divisor (GCD) between them will reveal that common factor. In this case, computing `gcd(n1, n2)` gives `p`, `gcd(n1, n3)` gives `q`, and `gcd(n2, n3)` gives `r`.

Once the primes are known, it's straightforward to derive the private keys for each modulus. Using these, the encryption can be reversed. The ciphertext is decrypted in three stages, each corresponding to one RSA decryption step using the appropriate private key and modulus.
