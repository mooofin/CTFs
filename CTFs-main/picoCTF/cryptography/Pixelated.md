To run my Python script that combines two scrambled PNG images using `Pillow` and `numpy` on Nix, I set up a temporary development environment using `nix-shell`. I used the command `nix-shell -p 'python3.withPackages (ps: with ps; [ pillow numpy ])'` to launch a shell with all the necessary Python dependencies available. Inside this shell, I ran my script, which loads the two image files (`scrambled1.png` and `scrambled2.png`), converts them into numpy arrays, and adds them together element-wise. Since pixel values must stay within the 0â€“255 range, I used `np.clip` to prevent overflow and then cast the result back to `uint8`. After that, I used `Image.fromarray` to convert the combined array back into an image and saved it as `out.png`. 



```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import os

file_names = ["scrambled1.png", "scrambled2.png"]
img_data = [np.asarray(Image.open(f'{name}')) for name in file_names]

data = img_data[0].copy() + img_data[1].copy()

new_image = Image.fromarray(data)
new_image.save("out.png", "PNG")
```
