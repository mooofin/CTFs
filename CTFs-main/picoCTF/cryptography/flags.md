The challenge presents an image (`flag.png`) containing a series of decorated squares, which, upon inspection, are recognized as maritime signal flags from the International Code of Signals. Each of these flags corresponds to a specific letter or number, commonly used in naval communication. By referencing a standard chart for these flags, we decode the sequence to reveal the characters “F1AG5AND5TUFF”. When formatted according to the hint provided (`PICOCTF{}`), the decoded message gives us the final flag: `PICOCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}`.
