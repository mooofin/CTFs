### RSA with Small Exponent (e = 3)
In this challenge, we are given an RSA public key with a very small exponent (`e = 3`) and a ciphertext (`c`). The modulus (`N`) is extremely large, but the ciphertext itself is relatively short. This suggests that the plaintext (`m`) might be small enough such that \( m^3 \) does not exceed `N`.
