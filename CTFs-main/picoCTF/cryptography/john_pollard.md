Since the objective was to analyze and potentially break the RSA certificate, the standard approach involved inspecting the contents of the X.509 certificate. This was done using OpenSSL with the command: `openssl x509 -in cert -text -noout`. Running this displayed detailed certificate information, including the version, serial number, signature algorithm, issuer, and subject details. Notably, the certificate was using the outdated `md2WithRSAEncryption` algorithm and had validity dates that were inconsistent â€” the expiration (`Not After`) occurred before the issue date (`Not Before`). The RSA public key information revealed a very short 53-bit modulus: `4966306421059967`, with a standard public exponent of `65537`. This extremely small modulus made the RSA vulnerable to factorization. Indeed, factoring `4966306421059967` resulted in the two primes: `67867967` and `73176001`, making it trivial to compute the private key and break the encryption. This led to the final flag in the format `picoCTF{73176001,67867967}`, capturing the two prime factors used in the weak RSA setup.
