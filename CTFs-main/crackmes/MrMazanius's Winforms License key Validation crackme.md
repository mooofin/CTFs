We were provided with a simple CrackMe challenge consisting of two files: `Crackme.exe` and `Crackme.dll`. The objective was to find the correct license key that, when entered into the application, would display the message: *"Correct license key!"* Otherwise, the application would respond with *"Invalid license key. Please try again."*

Upon launching the application, a GUI appeared prompting the user to input a license key. At first, we attempted to analyze `Crackme.exe` using dnSpy, a popular .NET reverse engineering tool. However, we quickly noticed that `Crackme.exe` only displayed PE headers and section data, with no decompiled .NET code or methods. This indicated that the executable was likely a native wrapper or launcher and that the actual license-checking logic resided elsewhere.

We then turned our attention to `Crackme.dll`, which, when opened in dnSpy, revealed a fully decompilable .NET assembly. Navigating through the module, we located the `Form1` class and the `button1_Click` method â€” the event handler triggered when the license validation button was pressed. Inside this method, we found a simple conditional check that compared the contents of `textBox1` (the license input field) to a hardcoded string.

The relevant code was straightforward: if `textBox1.Text` equaled `"YouFoundTheLicenseKey"`, the program would display a success message. Otherwise, it would indicate failure. From this, it was immediately clear that the correct license key was simply the hardcoded string: `YouFoundTheLicenseKey`.

To verify our findings, we ran the application again and entered `YouFoundTheLicenseKey` into the license field. As expected, the application responded with the success message, confirming that the key was correct. This concluded the challenge.
