In this lab, the goal was to perform a clickjacking attack to change the email address associated with a victim's account. After logging into the target website as the user `wiener`, I examined the `/my-account` page and confirmed that it allowed updating the email address via a form. I then accessed the provided exploit server at `https://exploit-0a030074041d1101802625c4019700d4.exploit-server.net/`, which allowed me to craft and host a malicious HTML page. The exploit consisted of an invisible iframe that loaded the target website's `/my-account` page with a pre-filled email value (`hacker@evil.com`), along with a decoy `<div>` element labeled "Click me" that was visually aligned to sit exactly over the iframe’s “Update email” button. The iframe had a `sandbox="allow-forms"` attribute to bypass any framebusting scripts while still permitting form submission. I initially set the iframe opacity to `0.1` for alignment and then reduced it to `0.0001` for stealth. After verifying that the cursor changed to a pointer when hovering over the decoy, I finalized the exploit and clicked “Deliver exploit to victim.”
