To complete this Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) lab, the goal was to trick a victim into unknowingly updating their account email by interacting with a disguised iframe. The first step involved logging in to the target website to observe how the email update form functions and where it's located. Once familiar with the form's structure, I navigated to the exploit server provided by the lab environment.

On the exploit server, I created a crafted HTML payload that uses an iframe to silently load the target account update form while visually displaying a decoy element ("Click me") to lure user interaction. The core of the exploit relied on overlaying a div over the target button inside the iframe, thereby making it seem like the user is clicking something harmless when, in reality, they're submitting a form on another domain.

I customized the template as follows: the `iframe` was set to a width of `500px` and height of `700px`, while the `div` was positioned at `top: 400px` and `left: 80px` to align it precisely over the "Update email" button of the target form. The iframe’s `opacity` was initially set to `0.1` for easier alignment of the decoy div. After confirming the alignment by viewing the exploit and ensuring the cursor changed to a pointer when hovering over the text "Test me," I adjusted the text to say "Click me" for the final version. Then, I reduced the iframe opacity to `0.0001` to make the form effectively invisible to the victim.

Additionally, I updated the iframe's `src` to include the correct lab ID, ensuring it pointed to the actual target domain and the intended email update endpoint. I also modified the email address in the query to something other than my own, such as `hacker@attacker-website.com`.

Finally, after storing and verifying the exploit, I delivered it to the victim. When they clicked the visually harmless "Click me" button, it triggered a hidden request to the target website to change the victim’s account email, successfully completing the CSRF-based attack and solving the lab.
