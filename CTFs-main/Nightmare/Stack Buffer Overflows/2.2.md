The core vulnerability is that the program reads 32 bytes of input into a buffer (`vulnBuf`) that is only 16 bytes long. This overflow allows writing over adjacent variables on the stack. The key target for this overwrite is a character pointer named `target`, which holds the address of a message to be printed by the `puts()` function at the end of the program.

***

The exploit works by crafting a payload that fills the buffer with 20 bytes of padding and then appends the static memory address where the program has already stored the flag (`0x0804a080`). This payload overwrites the `target` pointer with the flag's address. When the program later calls `puts(target)`, instead of printing a standard message, it prints the string located at the new address, successfully leaking the flag.

***
Also another interesting this is to pass the password check, you need to manually add a null byte (`\0`) because the `fgets` function includes the newline character (`\n`) from pressing Enter in your input. The `strcmp` function compares strings byte-by-byte, and it will see a mismatch between the stored password, which ends with a null terminator (`P@SSW0RD\0`), and your input, which ends with a newline (`P@SSW0RD\n\0`). By providing the null byte yourself (`P@SSW0RD\x00`), you tell `strcmp` that your input string ends right after the 'D', making it an exact match to the stored password before the unwanted newline is ever considered.
