### **Finding the Vulnerability**

My primary target is the **return address**. After setting a breakpoint immediately after the program reads input, I use the `info frame` command. This command provides a map of the memory, showing two critical pieces of information:
1.  The starting memory address of the **input buffer**.
2.  The memory address where the **return address** is stored.

Once I have these two addresses, I calculate the **offset** between them. I do this by subtracting the buffer's starting address from the return address's location. This calculation gives me the exact number of bytes I need to write to overflow the buffer and reach the return address. In this case, the result was `0x28`, or 40 bytes.

### **Building and Executing the Exploit**

With the offset known, I then write a Python script using the `pwntools` library to automate the attack.

First, I have the script launch the program and read its output to capture the memory address of the input buffer, which the program prints. I store this address because it is where my shellcode will be located.

Next, I construct the malicious payload in three parts:
1.  **Shellcode**: I start with the shellcode, which is the set of machine instructions that will open a command shell.
2.  **Padding**: I calculate the necessary padding to fill the gap between my shellcode and the return address. The formula for this is `40 - (length of my shellcode)`.
3.  **New Return Address**: Finally, I append the new return address. I use the `p64()` function to format the buffer address I saved earlier. This tells the program to "return" to the start of my input, where the shellcode is waiting.

To execute the exploit, I send this completed payload to the program. When the vulnerable function finishes, it uses the address I provided, causing it to jump to my shellcode. I then use the `interactive()` function to gain control of the new shell.
